#Adding plugins

GorillaBot was designed to be easily extensible. Adding commands is relatively simple:

1. Either edit an existing `.py` file in the `/plugins` directory, or create a new file.
    1.1 If you choose to add a new file, append the file name (sans the file extensions) to the `__all__` variable in the `__init__.py` file in `/plugins`.
