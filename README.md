# GorillaBot
GorillaBot is an IRC bot framework written in Python. The bot is initiated from the command line. Once it is connected, it receives [its commands](https://github.com/mollywhite/GorillaBot/blob/master/docs/commands.md) through IRC.

Although I wrote the framework to run _Alfred_, a bot specific to an IRC channel I use frequently, it is easily-configurable to run any bot you like. It will include some optional modules, and any extra functionality can be added by forking the code.
