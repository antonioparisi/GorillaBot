# Commands

The bot receives commands in one of three ways:

1. Detecting a word preceded by an exclamation point: `!command`<br/>
2. Receiving a message addressed to it directly: `GorillaBot: command` or `GorillaBot: !command`<br/>
3. Receving a command in a private message: `/msg GorillaBot command`
